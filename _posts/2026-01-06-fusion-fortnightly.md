<p>After an all-too-exciting end to 2025 in the fusion world, 2026 starts out relatively quiet.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.shinefusion.com/blog/shine-completes-acquisition-lantheus-spect">SHINE acquires Lantheus SPECT, expanding its nuclear medicine portfolio.</a> SHINE has long based its roadmap to commercial fusion energy with the route going through the commercial radioisotope market, among other non-energy destinations. This merger further advances its capabilities in the <a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/non-power-nuclear-applications/radioisotopes-research/radioisotopes-in-medicine">medical radioisotope</a> markets. SHINE has been building up the systems and expertise to produce isotopes using its D-T fusion neutron generators (in this case, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_molybdenum#Molybdenum-99">molybdenum-99</a>) and Lantheus SPECT has built up a commercial business in the downstream processing, packaging, and distribution of medical radioisotopes. While SHINE is proving that there is a route to a successful non-energy fusion business, I remain skeptical that its plans position them well to be a major player in the fusion industry. They are executing on a more conservative pathway, which leaves it vulnerable to fusion primaries that are laser-focused on the energy mission.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/us-fusion-strategy-stuck-past-china-moves-ahead-ceo-warns">"The U.S. government, long a proponent of fusion, is not currently structured to be able to take advantage of the moment and really lead to energy dominance," says the CFS CEO in an interview.</a> This continues the story in the last fortnightly of the NYT reporting on China's rise in fusion. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ans.org/news/2026-01-05/article-7635/the-nrc-is-back-to-five-commissioners/">With the confirmation of Douglas Weaver, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is back to five commissioners.</a> Having a full five-person commission will hopefully help it make progress on <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/materials/fusion/rulemaking-status">fusion-relevant rulemaking</a>, which is critical for the industry.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fourteenth-annual-japan-uk-nuclear-dialogue/fourteenth-annual-uk-japan-civil-nuclear-dialogue-summary-of-discussions">The summary of UK-Japan civil nuclear dialogue has been published.</a> This is an important exchange, as the UK and Japan have been historically strong centers of fusion energy R&D. With the UK losing the connection to Japan through Euratom and the <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/research-and-technology/fusion-energy-and-iter/broader-approach_en">Broader Approach</a> after Brexit, this dialogue is even more important. Some key follow-ups this year include: 1. Harmonised, proportionate fusion regulation, codes, and standards, including direct regulator-to-regulator engagement and a UK delegation to Japan focused on codes and standards. 2. A push toward reciprocal facilities access and lab-to-lab collaborations (UKAEA with Japan’s QST/NIFS), especially on major projects like LIBRTI, CHIMERA, RACE, and JT-60SA. 3. Follow-up on UK–Japan fusion supply-chain cooperation and public-private partnership proposals. These two countries are setting a great standard for aligning and strengthing their fusion programs together.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/commonwealth-fusion-systems-installs-reactor-magnet-lands-deal-with-nvidia/">CFS installs the first superconducting magnet in the tokamak hall.</a> This is such a wonderful sight for me to see, as I built and led the team that produced the first structural designs of this magnet. It was a heck of a lot of fun coming up with a bunch of crazy concepts. The shape of the magnet is due to similar physics as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary">catenary</a> curve seen in cables/chains hanging in gravity. The difference here is that the <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/5233082">shape is due to the forces of the magnetic field on the current in the magnet</a>. This is a big day for everyone involved, and I wish a hearty congradulations to the team! </p>
