<h2>Regulatory</h2>
<p><a href="https://world-nuclear-news.org/articles/terrestrial-energy-oklo-execute-DOE-agreements">Terrestrial Energy and Oklo</a> sign <a href="https://acqnotes.com/acqnote/careerfields/other-transaction-authority-ota">Other Transaction Authority</a> (OTA) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The OTAs let these companies rapidly construct and operate experimental reactors on federal sites, with companies bearing costs but potentially gaining more agile regulatory approval, not having to go through lengthy Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval processes. Oh how times have changed. In the pre-CFS days we discussed the trade-offs of doing SPARC on a DOE site under their rules versus a non-DOE site uner NRC rules, and then thought that the NRC route would be easier for things like use of tritium in SPARC despite the NRC's lack of a clear pathway at that point for regulating fusion.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tmia.com/sites/tmia.com/files/media/DOE%20ALARA%20Memo_01092026.pdf">DOE proposes "removal of 'as low as reasonably achievable' (ALARA) principle from all DOE directives and regulations."</a> This would be a very impactful change to how radiation risks are managed. As referenced in the memo, dose rates below 5,000 mrem/year (NRC maximum dose for a radiation worker; here I am obligated to post the <a href="https://xkcd.com/radiation/">XKCD Radiation Chart</a> to put radiation doses in context</p>) show no detectable increases in adverse health outcomes. So, the past policy of pushing doeses to "as low as reasonably achievable" is likely not a sound principle and has probably caused "excessive economic and operational burdens" on the nuclear industry. Note that the NRC would need to also adjust their rules on ALARA for this to have the full impact the nuclear industry needs.</p> 
<p></p>This is a fascinating area for me to watch, as it is at the intersection of the development of new technologies and public acceptance. Globally, there is a powerful, vocal minority of people that are afriad of radiation in a way that doesn't make sense from a purely logical, technical point of view. Experiments on two stellarators, <a href="https://nifs-repository.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_uri&item_id=10740&file_id=22&file_no=1">LHD</a> and <a href="https://www.ipp.mpg.de/17064/strahlenschutz">W7-X</a>, were both delayed when locals protested against them due to their radiation generation; despite it all being well contained within the experimental facilities and far less than anything a fission plant has produced. A proponent of ALARA may claim that such a policy is critical for getting the public's trust, as any radiation release could cause strong negative reactions. An opponent of ALAR may claim that such a policy is part of the problem, it creates the false perception that any dose of radiation is harmful. I am optimistic that getting rid of ALARA will be benificial in the long run.

<p><a href="ttps://www.nrc.gov/materials/fusion/vision-strategy">Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued an updated “Vision and Strategy: Regulating Fusion Machines."</a> It now explicitly incorporates <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML2508/ML25084A158.pdf">ADVANCE Act</a> implementation. It also adds a more concrete “path to commercialization” milestone indicators of industry readiness (Appendix B). The schedules are made more explicit (e.g., proposed rule and draft guidance in 2026; final rule and licensing guidance by the 12/31/2027 legislative deadline; fee structure and inspection program in 2027). The action tables include concrete examples like reviews of Helion, Type One Energy, TAE, and CFS applications.</p>

<h2>Energy markets</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/meta-strikes-nuclear-power-agreements-with-three-companies-2026-01-09/">Meta signs up for 6.6 GW of fission power by 2035</a> in agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, and Oklo. This is about the same amount of power the city-state of <a href="https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/singapore-energy-statistics/chapter3"> Singapore consumes</a>! The ramping up of support for the fission industry is a double-edged sword for fusion: on the one hand, it's great because it signals strong, growing demand for firm, baseload power and a growing societal acceptance of nuclear energy (fission or fusion); on the other hand a growing fission industry with stronger societal backing undercuts some of fusion's advantages. In the end, the world will probably be big and complex enough to need both.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/bill-gates-backed-type-one-energy-raises-87m-ahead-of-250m-series-b/">Type One Energy raises first $87M of Series B</a> with target of $250M. While nowhere near enough to build an HTS stellarator of any consequence, if they raise the full $250M it be a significant boolster to the team's R&D and design capabilities.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1867964/000186796426000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">Avalanche Energy has raised $14.86M</a> towards a target of $20M as indicated in their Form D filing. Note that coming up short of the target in a Form D does not indicate they were not able to sell the whole round as a Form D is due within 15 days after the first sale and it doesn't have to be updated if more is sold.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/startorus-funding-468930">Chinese startup Startorus Fusion raised ¥1 billion ($143 million) in Series A funding.</a> Working on a high-field spherical torus, Startorus Fusion is basically the Tokamak Energy of China. I hope these funds help them build their <a href="https://startorus.com/planning/">negative triangularity spherical tokamak</a>, which would be a very interesting physics experiment.</p>

<h2>Companies</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.otcmarkets.com/filing/html?id=19052144&guid=HJt-kaBVsNSKFBh">TAE anounces site selection criteria.</a> One of the positives of TAE working to go public is more release of information like this. Although there was not much suprprising in their requirements (e.g., be near a pool of talent), TAE did indicate they wanted 20 acres to build the first 50 MWe plant, a future 350 MWe plant </p>

All companies taking part in this program have a preconceptual design review milestone, so expect more in the coming year.</p>
