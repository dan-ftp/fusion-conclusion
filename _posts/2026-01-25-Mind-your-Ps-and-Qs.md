<H1>Mind your P's and Q's: Understanding power and gain in fusion systems</H1>

<em>Depending on who you ask, Q – the ratio of fusion power to heating power – is either the most important number for fusion energy or it does not matter at all. They are both right.</em>

<p>In my <a href="https://www.fusionconclusion.com/q-1-the-starting-gun-for-the-race-to-commercialize-fusion/">recent essay</a>, I discussed how many investors are waiting on the sidelines to get into the fusion race until Q>1 (breakeven) is demonstrated by a private fusion company. In this essay I throw all of that rhetoric out and show why Q>1 does not matter at all (spoiler: it's not a true threshold and was adopted largely as a manner of comparison and communication convenience). I'll also show where and how Q is actually important.</p>

<p>To help understand your fusion Q's, I will make liberal use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram">Sankey diagrams</a> to depict power flows (fusion P's) through a variety of fusion systems, including experiments (particle accelerators, JET, and NIF) as well as power plant concepts (standard deuterium-tritium with thermal energy conversion, deuterium-helium3 with direct energy conversion, and fusion rockets).</p>

<H2>Punch line</H2>

<p>While one can debate the merits of various fusion concepts <em>ad infinitum</em>, at the end of the day none of it matters if it cannot be a commercially viable system. The only breakeven value that matters is that sale of what the fusion system produces must be competitive commercially against other technologies. The most elegant physics or engineering solutions to individual problems do not matter unless P (for profits) is greater than zero. What follows is an examination and explanation behind the various parts of a fusion system that contribute to this bottom line.</p>
