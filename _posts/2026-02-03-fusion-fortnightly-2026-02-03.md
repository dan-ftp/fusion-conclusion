*No fluff, all facts.*

General Fusion SPACs and ORNL is getting busy collaborating with private industry.
---
In the big news of the week, [General Fusion SPACs](https://generalfusion.com/post/general-fusion-business-combination-announcement/). Much like the TAE deal, I believe this to be a result of 1. General Fusion's promising fusion energy 5-10 years out for over 20 years; 2. private investors getting tired of that story and consolodating to the more credible fusion companies that appear to be delivering; and 3. the tailwinds of the AI / data center energy boom. Going to the public markets satisfies the long-time General Fusion investors with liquidity and funds the next step of General Fusion's R&D.
